# Machine Learning Course Project Winter 2021

## üìå Overview
This project uses data from the article with ID: PMC6468888 to implement and evaluate various machine learning classifiers including K-Neighbors, GaussianNB, SVM, and Random Forest. Feature selection techniques like information gain, chi2, and Lasso were used, and PCA was employed for data visualization.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Implement Classification Methods**: To explore and identify the most effective classifier for the dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: Employ information gain, chi2, and Lasso methods to enhance model performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize PCA to simplify the visual representation of complex datasets.

## üîç Project Files
- `ML_project.py`: Main script for running the classification models and feature selection.
- `gdc_download_20210105_232454.032551.tar.gz`: Compressed file containing the raw dataset.
- `gdc_sample_sheet.2021-01-07.tsv`: Metadata associated with the dataset.
- `ML_project report.pdf`: Comprehensive project report detailing the methodologies, analysis, and outcomes.
